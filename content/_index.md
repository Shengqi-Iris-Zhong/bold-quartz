      title: "My Journey"
      subtitle: ""
      text: |-
        I am broadly interested in understanding the human mind and behavior throug quantitative methods, which initially led me to study language acquisition during my undergraduate years. My [honors thesis](https://scholarworks.smith.edu/theses/2374/) examined how children learn rules in an artificial language.

        Through this work, I developed an interest in statistics and working with children, which motivated me to pursue a master’s degree in Education Data Science. During my graduate training, I focused on psychometrics, and my [capstone project](https://ed.stanford.edu/eds/project/modeling-student-growth-over-time-in-algebra-i-from-a-digital-learning-environment) analyzed item-level response data from a digital learning platform to model students’ learning trajectories over time within an Algebra I curriculum.

        In my current role at Education Analytics, I work with large-scale K–12 datasets, conducting psychometric analyses of social-emotional learning surveys, assessing student growth, and exploring applied analytics using Ed-Fi data.
