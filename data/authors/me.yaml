bio: "Hi! I’m Iris Zhong 钟圣祺, and I am a research analyst at Education Analytics. I hold a master’s degree in Education Data Science from Stanford University, and I double majored in Psychology and Quantitative Economics at Smith College. I enjoy every part of working with data, from cleaning and exploring messy datasets, to building models, to creating a compelling data story. Much of my work focuses on large-scale education data. Outside of work, you’ll usually find me watching far too many cat videos, experimenting in the kitchen, or making suboptimal latte. "
